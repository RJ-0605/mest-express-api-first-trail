git commit -m " static changes made usage in README.md "


haven't joined the database models so one can signup during runtime and the course optimizer which is on a different backend api (python ) does  the course optimization for the students, the course are displayed on the students dashboard ( the static login username, password after signing up with any username and password are both  [ testuser1] ) . This the link to that project  I just completed the data normalization on mongodb for the project so the information during runtime can be saved
